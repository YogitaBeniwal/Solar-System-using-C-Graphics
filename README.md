# Solar System using C Graphics created in 2021

This repository contains a C program to visualize the solar system using graphics in C. The program displays the orbits of the planets and their motion around the sun.

## Code Overview

The code utilizes the graphics.h library to create a graphical representation of the solar system. Here's a brief overview of the code structure:

- The `planetMotion` function calculates the position of planets on their respective orbits.
- The `main` function initializes the graphics mode and manipulates the positions of the planets and their orbits.
- The program continuously updates the positions of the planets and their orbits to simulate their motion.

## Output

## Dependencies
The code depends on the following libraries:
- `stdio.h`
- `conio.h`
- `graphics.h`
- `dos.h`
- `math.h`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the C code using a C compiler that supports the graphics library (e.g., Turbo C).
3. Run the compiled executable to visualize the solar system.
4. Press any key to exit the program.

## Features
- Visual representation of the solar system with orbits and planets.
- Realistic motion of planets around the sun.

## Author
This solar system visualization program was created by Yogita Beniwal.
